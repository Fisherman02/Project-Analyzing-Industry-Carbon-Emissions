Our data, which is publicly available on nature.com, contains product carbon footprints (PCFs) for various companies. PCFs are the greenhouse gas emissions attributable to a given product, measured in CO2 (carbon dioxide equivalent).

This data is stored in a PostgreSQL database containing one table, prouduct_emissions, which looks at PCF by-products as well as the stage of production in which these emissions occurred. Here's a snapshot of what product_emissions contains in each column:
